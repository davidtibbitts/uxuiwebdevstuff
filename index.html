<h2>About Me</h2>

        Student at UC Berkeley Extension studying UX and UI Design with a keen eye for compelling visual experiences. Thrives in an agile startup environment and enjoys working cross functionally. Intrigued by AR, wearables, and IoT.
<br>
<br>
        Possesses a diverse tapestry of work experience, from serving bottomless breadsticks at Olive Garden to cold-calling small business owners at Yelp. This results in a high capacity for empathy, David’s UX superpower.As Vivino’s first Account Executive, David built the world’s largest wine eCommerce marketplace from the ground up, with an emphasis on enterprise accounts and launching international markets.
<br>
<br>   
        As an undergraduate, David was a coach and competitor on the Speech and Debate team and held a part time job working 30+ hours/week. He graduated Magna Cum Laude in four years with a double major, and looks forward to applying this same work ethic to each and every UX project.
